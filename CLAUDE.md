# DroneDeploy GTM Exercise - Project Context

## Overview
This is a take-home exercise for DroneDeploy to generate personalized outbound emails for conference speakers at Digital Construction Week. The goal is to invite potential customers to visit booth #42 for a demo and free gift.

## Task Requirements
- **Target Audience**: Conference speakers who are potential DroneDeploy customers
- **Customer Categories**:
  - **Builders**: General contractors, specialty contractors, engineering firms (those building things)
  - **Owners**: Those getting things built for them
  - **Exclude**: Competitors and potential partners
- **Time Limit**: 2 hours
- **Conference**: Digital Construction Week (already passed - outputs won't be used)

## Technical Requirements
- Python with asyncio for concurrent operations
- LLM integration (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google)
- Output: CSV file with speaker details and personalized emails
- Environment variables for API keys

## Data Structure
Pre-scraped HTML files are in `in/scraped_pages/speakers/[speaker-name]/index.html`

Each speaker page contains:
```html
<div class="speaker-details">
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> [Speaker Name]</p>
    <p><strong>Company:</strong> [Company Name]</p>
    <p><strong>Job Title:</strong> [Job Title]</p>
</div>
```

## Implementation Plan (Iterative Approach)

### Step 1: Extract Speaker Data
- Parse HTML files using BeautifulSoup
- Extract: Name, Company, Job Title
- Save to JSON for processing
- Handle edge cases (missing data)

### Step 2: Enrich with Tavily API
- Search for company + construction industry context
- Cache results to avoid duplicate API calls
- Get company descriptions, industry focus, recent news

### Step 3: Classify Companies
- Use LLM to classify based on enriched data
- Categories: Builder, Owner, Partner, Competitor, Other
- Include reasoning for classification

### Step 4: Generate Personalized Emails
- Create compelling subject lines
- Personalize body based on:
  - Company category
  - Person's role/title
  - Company's specific needs
- Emphasize booth #42 and free gift
- Keep professional but engaging tone

### Step 5: Export to CSV
- Required columns:
  - Speaker Name
  - Speaker Title
  - Speaker Company
  - Company Category
  - Email Subject
  - Email Body

```

## API Keys Required
- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: For web search and enrichment
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For LLM classification and generation

## Performance Considerations
- Use asyncio for concurrent API calls
- Cache Tavily results to avoid duplicates
- Batch LLM requests where possible
- Show progress with tqdm
- Handle rate limits gracefully

## Email Strategy
- **Builders**: Focus on efficiency, ROI, project management
- **Owners**: Focus on visibility, cost control, project oversight
- **Tone**: Professional, value-focused, specific benefits
- **CTA**: Visit booth #42 for demo and free gift

## Working with this Project

**Claude Code will**:
- Read this file automatically each session (persistent memory)
- Check `@in/DD_TASK.md` for requirements alignment
- Ask you to update this file when we make decisions

**This file tracks**: Progress, decisions, and context across sessions.

## Progress Tracker

### Completed
- âœ… Project structure created
- âœ… All utility modules implemented (parser, enrichment, classifier, email_generator)
- âœ… Main orchestration script ready
- âœ… Documentation setup

### Next Steps
- ðŸ”„ Test with real API keys
- ðŸ”„ Run full pipeline on sample data
- ðŸ”„ Refine email templates based on results

## Implementation Decisions

### Data Source
- Using pre-scraped HTML files in `in/scraped_pages/`
- Saves time, ensures consistent testing

### API Strategy
- **Tavily**: Web search for company context
- **OpenAI/Anthropic**: Classification and email generation
- **Caching**: Store Tavily results to avoid duplicate calls

### Classification Rules
- Focus on Builders and Owners only
- Skip Competitors and Partners for emails
- Include confidence scores

### Email Generation
- Personalized based on category + role
- Emphasize booth #42 and free gift
- Professional tone, 3-4 sentences

## Session Notes

### Session 1 (Initial Setup)
- Created project structure
- Implemented all modules
- Set up documentation system

### Session 2 (Your next session)
- [Updates will go here]
