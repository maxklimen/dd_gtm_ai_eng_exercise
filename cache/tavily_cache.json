A few infrastructure assets that will be incorporated into a digital twin solution include highways and roads, dams and bridges, waterways, and many more. Private and public infrastructure must maintain their assets regularly, making the switch from manual inspection to a digital twin solution a no brainer when hundreds of billions of dollars are at stake.\n\n## How Can Drone Data Be Used to Make a Digital Twin? [...] Digital twins allow asset owners, engineers, inspectors and designers to not only understand the current condition of assets and infrastructure through remote digital inspection, but digital twins allow them to understand changes over time, which leads to accurate predictions of function and degradation into the future. With this information owners are able to create accurate maintenance, cost, and expected asset life cycle modelling for their organizations.

        "content": "Digital transformation is on the rise across industries, and part of that is creating digital twins of physical assets. A digital twin is a digital representation of a physical object, which can include a 3D model along with other sensor data. A digital twin is used for monitoring, managing, and maintaining a physical asset.\n\n### Creating Digital Twins [...] Drones are playing a critical role in providing data to create digital twins. Getting a camera positioned over every location on an asset provides advantages in speed, frequency, and safety. Drone data is used to create a 3D model using photogrammetry, and inspect the asset.\n\nCapturing quality data with a drone to create a high-resolution 3D model can be difficult, especially for certain assets, such as two massive buildings in an urban environment.
