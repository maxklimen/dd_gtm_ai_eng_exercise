        "content": "Across the construction industry, companies use drones in slightly different ways, but in general, they have already improved project reporting clarity, project timelines, and the inspection process to deliver a faster, more efficient, reliable construction operations process. Even though they are a relatively new technology, drones have already had a significant impact on changing the construction industry. Expectations around surveying and project timelines have been significantly raised, and [...] confusion when tracking project progress and verifying different project elements are correctly in place. The increased efficiency, accuracy, and security that drone surveying provides has already gone a long way in the construction industry to improve project timelines and ensure that clients\u2019 expectations are consistently met. [...] Any significant construction project tends to involve multiple subcontractors who are hired to complete specialized tasks that are a part of the larger project. Some subcontractors are more focused on finishing their part of the project, without keeping the bigger picture in mind.

Broadly, a digital transformation involves two types of change: business-model innovation, whereby companies introduce digitally enabled products and services, and operational improvement, whereby companies apply advanced technologies and ways of working to enhance the development and delivery of projects. Scenarios such as this remain all too common in the engineering and construction (E&C) sector, which is one of the world\u2019s least digitized.1\u201c[Reinventing construction through a productivity revolution](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/reinventing-construction-through-a-productivity-revolution),\u201d McKinsey Global Institute, February 2017. When we assessed construction companies that successfully implemented digital technologies and ways of working, we found that, despite differing conditions, their transformations had five practices in common, from which other E&C companies embarking on similar transformations may learn: Focus on fixing pain points, not installing IT solutions. In this article, we offer a closer look at how E&C companies can realize benefits like these.",

        "content": "Construction drones can generate a range of deliverables, including high-resolution aerial imagery, 2D orthomosaic maps, 3D models, digital elevation models (DEMs), and LiDAR scans, providing precise data for project managers and stakeholders. Drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and LiDAR sensors can swiftly capture detailed aerial imagery and topographic data of construction sites. Regular drone flights enable project managers to monitor construction progress in real time, ensuring adherence to schedules and budgets. Drones enhance communication among project stakeholders by providing clear, up-to-date visuals of the construction site. Construction companies use drone surveying for site analysis, topographic mapping, progress monitoring, and volumetric calculations. ### How do drones improve safety on construction sites?",
